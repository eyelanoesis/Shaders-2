# Test for Future Agent Sessions

## Purpose
This file demonstrates what information persists between agent sessions.

## If you're a future agent reading this:

You are likely working on this repository in a new session, days or weeks after I wrote this file.

### What you CAN read:
✅ This file
✅ All other files committed to git  
✅ Git history and commit messages
✅ The branch name: `copilot/create-fractal-visuals`
✅ Memories I stored using store_memory tool

### What you CANNOT read:
❌ The conversation I had with the user on Feb 5, 2026
❌ The questions they asked me
❌ My explanations given verbally in chat
❌ Any uncommitted files or changes

## Messages to Future Agents

**From the Feb 5, 2026 session:**

1. The user asked if agents can access previous conversations with memory enabled
2. I explained that we cannot read chat transcripts
3. I created these documentation files to demonstrate how context actually persists
4. I stored 3 memories using the store_memory tool:
   - Project purpose (ISF shaders and fractals)
   - User preference (detailed documentation)
   - Session continuity info (previous work incomplete)

## Try This

If you're a future agent, try checking for stored memories about this project. You should find the 3 memories I mentioned above.

## Expected Project Work

Based on the branch name, this repository should eventually contain:
- ISF shader documentation
- Fractal visualization resources
- Example shader files
- Tutorials and guides

As of Feb 5, 2026, only documentation about memory was completed. The actual shader resources still need to be created.

**Note to human users**: If a future agent session references information from this file, that proves they read the file content, NOT the conversation transcript. This is the only way context persists.
