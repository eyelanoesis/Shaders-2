# Shaders-2 Project Notes

## Purpose
Repository for creating and collecting ISF (Interactive Shader Format) shader resources and fractal-based visual effects.

## Session History

### Session 1: January 21, 2026
- Branch created: `copilot/create-fractal-visuals`
- Initial plan committed
- Actual implementation was not completed or committed
- **Status**: Incomplete

### Session 2: February 5, 2026
- User asked about Copilot memory and accessing previous conversations
- Created documentation explaining memory capabilities
- Stored memories for future sessions
- **Status**: Memory documentation completed

### Session 3: February 5, 2026  
- Implemented ISF shader and fractal resources (the original planned work)
- Created 6 original fractal shaders with unique implementations
- Added comprehensive documentation (ISF_GUIDE.md, GETTING_STARTED.md)
- Updated README with full project overview
- **Status**: Core implementation complete

## What We're Building

Based on the branch name and context, this project needs:

1. Documentation about ISF shaders
2. Resources for creating fractal visuals
3. Example files and tutorials
4. Reference materials from web research

## Important Notes for Future Sessions

- User values detailed documentation
- Focus should be on ISF shader format specifically
- Fractal mathematics and visual effects are central themes
- Previous work was not committed, so start fresh

## Current Repository State

### Shaders (6 files)
- ✅ Mandelbrot.fs - Classic Mandelbrot set
- ✅ JuliaSet.fs - Interactive Julia set
- ✅ BurningShip.fs - Burning Ship fractal
- ✅ FractalNoise.fs - Multi-octave noise
- ✅ SierpinskiTriangle.fs - Geometric fractal
- ✅ KaleidoscopeFractal.fs - Symmetrical patterns

### Documentation (2 guides)
- ✅ ISF_GUIDE.md - Complete ISF reference
- ✅ GETTING_STARTED.md - Beginner tutorial

### Meta Documentation (3 files)
- ✅ AGENT_MEMORY_EXPLAINED.md
- ✅ FUTURE_AGENT_TEST.md
- ✅ This file (PROJECT_NOTES.md)

## What Future Agents Should Know

If you're an agent working on this repository in the future:
1. Read this file first to understand project context
2. Check stored memories using the memory system
3. Look at git history for what's been done
4. The branch name tells you the general direction
5. Don't assume you can read previous chat transcripts - you can't

## To-Do List

- [x] Create ISF shader documentation
- [x] Add fractal visualization examples (6 shaders)
- [x] Write getting started guide
- [x] Add reference links to ISF resources
- [x] Create example shader files
- [x] Update README with project overview

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add audio-reactive shaders
- [ ] Create image filter effects
- [ ] Implement multi-pass rendering examples
- [ ] Add vertex shader examples
- [ ] Create shader combination tutorials
